These data are available from NIDA Data Share through the HEAL Data Platform. There is an ongoing, dramatic rise in the number of opioid related overdose deaths in the United States, however only a small portion of patients who are diagnosed with Opioid Use Disorders (OUD) seek treatment and recieve medications for OUD (MOUD). MOUDs, like buprenorphine, can be effective forms of treatment for OUD patients, but only a portion of clinicians are waivered to, and in actuality do, prescribe buprenophine. A potential barrier to care for OUD patients may be the stigma held by primary care clinicians (PCCs) towards people with OUD. There are a limited number of interventions available for reducing OUD stigma among PCCs and a need for analytical support for the efficacy of these interventions. A randomized controlled trial of an intervention... examines whether PCCs' stigma towards people with OUD may be reduced and PCCs' intentions to treat OUD patients increased through online training interventions.

PCCs who are part of the 15 HealPartners clinics that have access to a CDS tool for identifying and treating people with OUD were invited to participate in the study. The study was a randomized, controlled trial where PCCs recieved one of two trainings: a stigma reduction training or an attention-control training. Following training, the PCCs were assesed at 6 months, 3 months and immediately following completion of the training for their stigma against people with OUD, their intention to get waivered, and their intention to prescribe buprenorphine. Of the 162 PCCs who were eligible, 85 completed both the training and the immediate post training survey (n=46 stigma training and n=39 attention-control training). The stigma reduction training was a series of videos recounting OUD patient narratives, examples of using non-stigmatizing language, and explanantions on how to use a Clincal Decision Support (CDS) tool designed to enable PCCs to screen, diagnose, and treat patients with OUD. The attention-control training controlled for contact, attention, and extra CDS tool training, but did not include the OUD patient narratives or examples of non-stigmatized language. The outcome measures which were used in this analysis were assessed through a survey immediately following training. The relevant primary and secondary outcome measurements were: - OUD Stigma - measured using the Blame , Disdain , and Difference scales and the composite Overall Stigma scale. - Intentions to get waivered or prescribe buprenorphine - measured on a 1-5 scale the likelihood to get waivered to prescribe buprenorphine or to prescribe buprenorphine should a waiver no longer be required. - Willingness to work with people with OUD - measured as the average of 3 questionnaire items (each scaled 1-5) from the Drug Problems Perceptions Questionnaire, where a higher score indicates a greater overall willingness to work with patients with OUD. - Opioid treatment outcome expectations - measured on a scale 1-4 on PCCs expecations for the effectiveness and likelihood of patient adherence to OUD treatment.

The mean and standard deviations for both training groups, as well as, the t-statistic, corresponding p-value, and Cohen's d-value all demonstrate that there are minimal or no significant differences between the two training groups across all measured training outcomes.

We use Pearson's correlation coefficients to measure the relation between the measured training outcomes. Unsurprisingly, the components for measuring stigma are strongly, positively correlated. We can also see moderate or high positive correlations between Perceived OUD treatment adherence and treatment effectiveness, between PCCs' intentions to get waivered and to prescribe buprenorphine, and between PCCs' willingness to work with OUD patients and the PCCs intentions to prescribe buprenorphine and their perceived OUD treatment effectiveness/adherence. There is also a slight or moderate negative correlation between PCCs' self-reported stigma and their intensions to work with OUD patients, their percieved OUD treatment effectiveness/adherence, and their intention to get waivered and prescribe buprenorphine. Conclusions \u00b6 The study demonstrated there was little relation between the provided stigma reduction training and PCCs' stigma, future intentions, willingness to work with OUD patients, or PCCs' perception of treatment effectiveness or patient treatment adherence. As was expected, there was a relation amongst PCCs' established stigma and their willingness to work with OUD patients and their perceptions of OUD treatment effectiveness and adherence. Since greater established PCC stigma is shown to inversely relate to PCCs' willingness to treat people with OUD, intentions to prescribe buprenophine, and perceptions regarding treatment effectiveness and patient adherence to treatment, it is important to find more effective intervention methods for reducing stigma.

PCCs who are part of the 15 HealPartners clinics that have access to a CDS tool for identifying and treating people with OUD were invited to participate in the study. The study was a randomized, controlled trial where PCCs recieved one of two trainings: a stigma reduction training or an attention-control training. Following training, the PCCs were assesed at 6 months, 3 months and immediately following completion of the training for their stigma against people with OUD, their intention to get waivered, and their intention to prescribe buprenorphine. Of the 162 PCCs who were eligible, 85 completed both the training and the immediate post training survey (n=46 stigma training and n=39 attention-control training). The stigma reduction training was a series of videos recounting OUD patient narratives, examples of using non-stigmatizing language, and explanantions on how to use a Clincal Decision Support (CDS) tool designed to enable PCCs to screen, diagnose, and treat patients with OUD. The attention-control training controlled for contact, attention, and extra CDS tool training, but did not include the OUD patient narratives or examples of non-stigmatized language. The outcome measures which were used in this analysis were assessed through a survey immediately following training. The relevant primary and secondary outcome measurements were: - OUD Stigma - measured using the Blame , Disdain , and Difference scales and the composite Overall Stigma scale. - Intentions to get waivered or prescribe buprenorphine - measured on a 1-5 scale the likelihood to get waivered to prescribe buprenorphine or to prescribe buprenorphine should a waiver no longer be required. - Willingness to work with people with OUD - measured as the average of 3 questionnaire items (each scaled 1-5) from the Drug Problems Perceptions Questionnaire, where a higher score indicates a greater overall willingness to work with patients with OUD. - Opioid treatment outcome expectations - measured on a scale 1-4 on PCCs expecations for the effectiveness and likelihood of patient adherence to OUD treatment.","title":"About The Study"},{"location":"notebooks/Stigma-Reduction-Among_PCCs/#demographic-summary-statistics-of-pccs-who-completed-stigma-or-attention-control-training","text":"print_df = make_print_df ( df ) Markdown ( print_df . to_markdown ()) Category All N=85 Stigma reduction n\u2009=\u200946 Attention-control n\u2009=\u200939 0 Gender - Female 57.65% 58.7% 56.41% 1 Gender - Male 36.47% 36.96% 35.9% 2 Gender - Prefer not to answer 4.71% 2.17% 7.69% 3 Gender - Not Listed 1.18% 2.17% 0.0% 0 - - - - 0 Ethnicity - Not Hispanic or Latino 94.12% 97.83% 89.74% 1 Ethnicity - Hispanic or Latino 3.53% 2.17% 5.13% 2 Ethnicity - Missing 2.35% 0.0% 5.13% 0 - - - - 0 Race - White 67.06% 63.04% 71.79% 1 Race - Prefer not to answer 14.12% 15.22% 12.82% 2 Race - Asian 9.41% 13.04% 5.13% 3 Race - Black or African American 7.06% 6.52% 7.69% 4 Race - Multiple selected 1.18% 0.0% 2.56% 5 Race - Some other race 1.18% 2.17% 0.0% 0 - - - - 0 Waivered to prescribe buprenorphine - False 90.59% 93.48% 87.18% 1 Waivered to prescribe buprenorphine - True 9.41% 6.52% 12.82% 0 - - - - 0 Degree - MD/DO 64.71% 65.22% 64.1% 1 Degree - PA/NP 35.29% 34.78% 35.9% In this first table we have a breakdown of the demographic characteristics of the participating PCCs split amongst the two training formats.

We use Pearson's correlation coefficients to measure the relation between the measured training outcomes. Unsurprisingly, the components for measuring stigma are strongly, positively correlated. We can also see moderate or high positive correlations between Perceived OUD treatment adherence and treatment effectiveness, between PCCs' intentions to get waivered and to prescribe buprenorphine, and between PCCs' willingness to work with OUD patients and the PCCs intentions to prescribe buprenorphine and their perceived OUD treatment effectiveness/adherence. There is also a slight or moderate negative correlation between PCCs' self-reported stigma and their intensions to work with OUD patients, their percieved OUD treatment effectiveness/adherence, and their intention to get waivered and prescribe buprenorphine.","title":"Correlations among Self-Reported Sitgma and Intentions to Treat People"},{"location":"notebooks/Stigma-Reduction-Among_PCCs/#conclusions","text":"The study demonstrated there was little relation between the provided stigma reduction training and PCCs' stigma, future intentions, willingness to work with OUD patients, or PCCs' perception of treatment effectiveness or patient treatment adherence. As was expected, there was a relation amongst PCCs' established stigma and their willingness to work with OUD patients and their perceptions of OUD treatment effectiveness and adherence. Since greater established PCC stigma is shown to inversely relate to PCCs' willingness to treat people with OUD, intentions to prescribe buprenophine, and perceptions regarding treatment effectiveness and patient adherence to treatment, it is important to find more effective intervention methods for reducing stigma.","title":"Conclusions"},{"location":"notebooks/Stigma-Reduction-Among_PCCs/#citations","text":"Hooker, Stephanie A et al. \u201cA randomized controlled trial of an intervention to reduce stigma toward people with opioid use disorder among primary care clinicians.\u201d Addiction science & clinical practice vol. 18,1 10. 11 Feb. 2023, doi:10.1186/s13722-023-00366-1 Hooker, S., Rossum, R., Crain, L., Bart, G. \"Reducing Stigma toward People with Opioid Use Disorder among Primary Care Clinicians.\" NIDA Data Share.
